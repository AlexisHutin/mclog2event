`mclog2event` is a lightweight little tool that watches your Minecraft server logs and turns them into events ‚Äî no mods, no datapacks, no hacks needed. Just tail your log file, catch stuff like player joins, chats, or custom modpack messages, and send it all to a webhook of your choice.

Great for automations, fun Discord bots, or just keeping an eye on what‚Äôs happening on your server without touching the game itself.

## üõ†Ô∏è Config

You set it up using environment variables:

| Env Var             | What it does                              | Required |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| `LOG_FILE_PATH`     | Path to the log file to watch             | ‚úÖ Yes   |
| `WEBHOOK_URL`       | Where to send the event (Discord, etc)    | ‚úÖ Yes   |
| `EVENT_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to your `events.yml` config          | ‚úÖ Yes   |

---

### Example `events.yml`

Here‚Äôs what an event config file looks like. You can define as many events as you want, using regex with named capture groups like `(?P<player>\w+)`.

```yaml
events:
  - event_type: "player_join"
    pattern: '(?P<player>\w+) joined the game'
    description: "A player joined the server."

  - event_type: "player_leave"
    pattern: '(?P<player>\w+) left the game'
    description: "A player left the server."

  - event_type: "player_chat"
    pattern: '<(?P<player>\w+)> (?P<message>.*)'
    description: "A player sent a chat message."

  - event_type: "player_advancement"
    pattern: '(?P<player>\w+) has made the advancement \[(?P<advancement>.*)\]'
    description: "A player made an advancement."
```

---

## üöÄ Running It

### Requirements

- Go 1.18+
- Minecraft server log file (`latest.log`)
- A webhook URL

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/mclog2event.git
cd mclog2event
go mod tidy

export LOG_FILE_PATH="/path/to/logs/latest.log"
export WEBHOOK_URL="https://your.webhook.url"
export EVENT_CONFIG_PATH="./events.yml"

go run main.go
```

### Run with Docker üê≥

```bash
docker build -t mclog2event .
```

Then run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e LOG_FILE_PATH=/logs/latest.log \
  -e WEBHOOK_URL="http://url.of/your/webhook" \
  -e EVENT_CONFIG_PATH=/events.yml \
  -v /path/to/logs/latest.log:/logs/latest.log \
  -v $(pwd)/events.yml:/events.yml \
  -p 2222:2222 \
  --name mclog2event \
  mclog2event
```

### Run with Docker Compose üê≥

Here‚Äôs an example `docker-compose.yml` to get you going:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mclog2event:
    build: .
    container_name: mclog2event
    ports: 
      - "2222:2222"
    volumes:
      # Mount the directory containing your Minecraft log file to /logs
      # Example: - /path/to/minecraft/logs:/logs
      - ./logs:/logs
      - ./events.yml:/events.yml
    environment:
      # The log file to watch inside the container.
      # This should be the name of your minecraft log file.
      - LOG_FILE_PATH=/logs/latest.log
      - WEBHOOK_URL=http://url.of/your/webhook # Replace with your webhook receiver
      - EVENT_CONFIG_PATH=/events.yml
```

Run it with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

---

## ‚ûï Adding Events

Just edit `events.yml` and add a new entry. The app will load it on startup. Use named regex capture groups to grab values and send them in the event payload.

---

## üìä Metrics / Observability

`mclog2event` exposes internal metrics via [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in Prometheus format, including:

- `logs_parsed_count` ‚Äî Number of logs parsed  
- `logs_parsed_duration_ms` ‚Äî  Logs parsing duration (milliseconds)  
- `logs_match_count` ‚Äî Number of matched events by type  
- `logs_match_duration_ms` ‚Äî Matching duration (milliseconds)  
- `logs_push_count` ‚Äî Number of webhook pushes  
- `logs_push_duration_ms` ‚Äî Push duration (milliseconds)

Metrics include labels to add context:

- **`type`**: event type for matched logs (e.g. `player_join`, `player_chat`)  
- **`matched`**: indicates if a parsed log matched an event (`true` or `false`)  

Labels enable fine-grained filtering and aggregation in Prometheus and Grafana.

Metrics are exposed on port `2222` at `/metrics` (configurable via Docker).  
You can scrape these with Prometheus to monitor your tool‚Äôs performance and health.

---

## üîß Prometheus Configuration Example

Here is an example scrape configuration to add to your Prometheus `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'mclog2event'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:2222']  # Change if running elsewhere
```

---

## üìà Grafana Dashboard

We‚Äôve got a ready-to-go Grafana dashboard you can import to visualize all the Prometheus metrics from `mclog2event`.  

It shows charts broken down by event type and whether logs matched or not, plus total values for each metric.

### How to use

1. Make sure Grafana is connected to your Prometheus data source scraping `mclog2event` metrics.
2. Import the dashboard JSON file:  
   - Go to **Grafana ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí New (dropdown) ‚Üí Import**
   - Upload the file [`mclog2event.json`](./devstack/grafana/dashboards/mclog2event.json)
3. Use the filters on top to zoom in on event types or match results.

This dashboard makes it easy to keep an eye on what‚Äôs happening in real time ‚Äî logs parsed, matched, pushed, and timing info.

## üöß TODO / Roadmap

Here‚Äôs a bunch of stuff I‚Äôd like to add, improve, or play with in the future:

- [x] Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry support  
  Expose internal metrics (e.g. matched events, errors, webhook push stats) to Prometheus.  
  Primary goal: gain hands-on experience with observability tools.

- [x] Grafana dashboard  
  Provide a ready-to-use Grafana dashboard to visualize logs and event activity.

- [ ] Example event configuration  
  Include a default `events.yml` with common Minecraft log patterns, ready to use for most vanilla servers.

- [ ] n8n workflow example  
  Provide an example [n8n](https://n8n.io) automation that reacts to incoming events.

- [ ] Documentation for regex capture patterns  
  Write a short guide explaining how named capture groups work in regex, using Minecraft log examples.

- [x] CI/CD pipeline  
  Set up GitHub Actions to build, lint, test, and maybe even release.

- [ ] Unit tests  
  Add some proper tests for the matcher logic and other core parts. Gotta break stuff with confidence.

- [x] Docker image publishing  
  Automatically publish a Docker image to Docker Hub or GHCR on release so folks can just `docker pull` and go.

- [ ] Add shoutrrr support (maybe)  
  Integrate [shoutrrr](https://github.com/containrrr/shoutrrr) to send events to services like Discord, Telegram, Slack, etc.

If you‚Äôve got ideas, feel free to open an issue or drop a PR.
